    <p>The longest tennis match ever which lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes…… In the last set the scoreboard stood still at
        47–47 and refused to move forward. When questioned about it, IBM programmers said the scoreboard was only set to
        go to 47–47 and assured that the problem would be fixed by the next day. And, it was fixed On the other hand the
        official website went on until 50–50 and was reset to 0–0 and users were asked to “please add 50 to the Isner/Mahut
        score” I’m still wondering what’s so special about 47……</p>

    <h3>Why, in a race track, are the athletes given different starting positions?</h3>
    <div class="askedby-user">
        <i class="fa fa-user"></i>Asked by Sujit Semakurthi</div>
    <p>The starting position is different for different type of race. For 100m all start from the same position and finish at
        the same position(here position is lateral sense with respect to all runners i.e. side by side),for 200m they are
        different and so on. The reason being the total distance the runner runs, this distance has to be equal for every
        runner. In 100m they run on a straight so the starting position and finishing positions are same for everyone. But
        in case of 200m or longer distances the track is part straight and part oval.</p>
