    <p>“A fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we
        are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe
        is a “mental” construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: “The stream of knowledge is heading toward
        a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no
        longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and
        governor of the realm of matter. Get over it, and accept the inarguable conclusion. The universe is immaterial-mental
        and spiritual.” – R.C. Henry, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University , “The Mental Universe”
        ; Nature 436:29,2005)</p>

    <p>A neutron star is a very small and dense star made almost completely of nuetrons. They are small stars with radius about
        11–11.5 km. They have a mass of about twice if that of the sun. They are smallest and densest stars known to exist
        in the universe. They are what is left after a huge star which exploded as a supernova.</p>
